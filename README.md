# Nildo-Game
A simple snake game that I made in tribute of my friend Romenildo Diniz. We work together at a granite company.

On the index website you gonna find a normal granite company website, thats not the point, the idea it's to scroll down and
find his picture on the supplies,
After Clicking on his picture, a snake game will start, simple javascript based snake game.

All thanks to American Stone crew and Romenildo Diniz to approve this awsome tribute.
